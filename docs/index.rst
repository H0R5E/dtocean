    **DTOcean** is the only open source fully parametric design tool for arrays 
    of ocean energy converters.

    -------------------

    **DTOcean** automates the design of an array of ocean energy converters 
    (OECs). Automated design helps catch errors early, reduce financial risk 
    and encourage innovation in array design and the supply chain. 

    Key Features
    ============

    **DTOcean** is accelerating tomorrow's energy generation technology with 
    advanced array design:

    - Optimal ocean energy converter (OEC) positioning
    - Cost-effective energy export
    - Station keeping designed for device and site conditions
    - Installation planning with weather effects
    - Maintenance needs and OEC downtime
    - A unique statistical approach to LCOE
    - Influence reliability at component level
    - Environmental impact assessment*
    - Graphical user interface
    - Persistent database
    - Wizard based installation
