# DTOcean Documentation

The DTOcean documentation is maintained in this repository. It can either be
viewed online at [dtocean.github.io](https://dtocean.github.io/), read as pdf
documentation or installed for offline use with the DTOcean graphical interface
(see [dtocean](https://github.com/DTOcean/dtocean)).

## Offline Manuals 

The DTOcean Manuals installation wizard can be downloaded from the [Releases](
https://github.com/DTOcean/dtocean.github.io/releases) page.

Once downloaded, simply double-click the file and follow the instructions.

This provides offline access to the manuals when using the DTOcean graphical 
interface, which should be installed alongside the manuals. 

## PDFs 

PDF versions of the DTOcean documentation can be downloaded from the 
[Releases](https://github.com/DTOcean/dtocean.github.io/releases) page.
